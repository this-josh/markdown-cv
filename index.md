## Currently

A junior data scientist at Siemens Digital Industries working within the Lighthouse team

### Projects

For the majority of my time within the Lighthouse I have working on SIWA Blockage Predictor, including side projects to advance our capabilities.

This project has involved:

* Exploratory data analysis
* Dealing with low quality and incomplete data
* Data wrangling
* Designing and training models
* Evaluating models

Side enhance projects have included:

* Developing a python package for producing consistent logs
* Producing a generalised model
* Researching different methods for automated data quality labelling of time series data




## Education
`2014 - 2019`
__Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool__

*BEng (hons)* Electrical and Electronic, first-class

During my degree I studied a wide range of modules giving me a rounded understand of electronics. Modules such as Engineering Mathematics and Signal Processing are obviously applicable to Data Science. While some of the modules that seem less applicable give me a key advantage in studying where data comes from, for example Digital and Analogue Electronics gave me an intricate understanding of how a sensor takes a reading and the limitations which can occur.
