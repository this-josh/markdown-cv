## About me
I am highly motivated and strive to improve myself with everything I do whilst completing it to the highest standard. I enjoy learning new things and therefore new challenges. I thrive on applying myself to problems which I haven’t previously encountered. When approaching an unfamiliar concept, I try to comprehend it fully through my own research. However, I am confident enough to ask a superior for advice if I encounter issues. I seek to improve practises to their maximum potential while also appreciating the importance of old methods.

## Currently

A junior data scientist at Siemens Digital Industries working within the Lighthouse team

### Projects

For the majority of my time within the Lighthouse I have working on SIWA Blockage Predictor, including side projects to advance our capabilities.

This project has involved:

* Exploratory data analysis
* Dealing with low quality and incomplete data
* Data wrangling
* Designing and training models
* Evaluating models

Side enhance projects have included:

* Developing a python package for producing consistent logs
* Producing a generalised model
* Researching different methods for automated data quality labelling of time series data




## Education
`2014 - 2019`
__Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool__

*BEng (hons)* Electrical and Electronic, first-class

During my degree I studied a wide range of modules giving me a rounded understand of electronics. Modules such as Engineering Mathematics and Signal Processing are obviously applicable to Data Science. While some of the modules that seem less applicable give me a key advantage in studying where data comes from, for example Digital and Analogue Electronics gave me an intricate understanding of how a sensor takes a reading and the limitations which can occur.

`2009-2014`
__Norton College, Norton__,   

8 *GCSE*'s from A to C including English and Maths

`2009-2014`
__Norton College, Norton__,   
*AS* EPQ research project "How environmentally friendly is civil aviation currently and how may it change in the future?”  
*A2*s in Physics, Geography, and Maths

## Awards

`2020` *Siemens* Doing what matters Finalist

## Occupation

`2019 - present`
